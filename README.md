# Port-Hamiltonian-Systems-Resources-and-Code
Resources (references, data, ...) and code for research on reduce-order modelling (ROM) of port-Hamiltonian systems by using neural networks.

Code is written in Python and Julia for simulation and data generation; respectively.
To generate toy data, run julia files in ODEExampleJulia folder, each file includes an example.
To execute ROM, run NeuralToda_LatNet.py in NeuralPHsPython folder.
