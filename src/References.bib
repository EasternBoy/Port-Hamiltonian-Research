  abstract = {Port-Hamiltonian theory is an established way to describe nonlinear physical systems widely used in various fields such as robotics, energy management, and mechanical engineering. This has led to considerable research interest in the control of Port-Hamiltonian systems, resulting in numerous model-based control techniques. However, the performance and stability of the closed-loop typically depend on the quality of the PH model, which is often difficult to obtain using first principles. We propose a Gaussian Processes (GP) based control approach for Port-Hamiltonian systems (GPC-PHS) by leveraging gathered data. The Bayesian characteristics of GPs enable the creation of a distribution encompassing all potential Hamiltonians instead of providing a singular point estimate. Using this uncertainty quantification, the proposed approach takes advantage of passivity-based robust control with interconnection and damping assignment to establish probabilistic stability guarantees.},

  abstract = {Data-driven approaches achieve remarkable results for the modeling of complex dynamics based on collected data. However, these models often neglect basic physical principles which determine the behavior of any real-world system. This omission is unfavorable in two ways: The models are not as data-efficient as they could be by incorporating physical prior knowledge, and the model itself might not be physically correct. We propose Gaussian Process Port-Hamiltonian systems (GPPHS) as a physics-informed Bayesian learning approach with uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian nature of GP-PHS uses collected data to form a distribution over all possible Hamiltonians instead of a single point estimate. Due to the underlying physics model, a GP-PHS generates passive systems with respect to designated inputs and outputs. Further, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.},

The dynamics and switching conditions are often hard to obtain or even inaccessible in case of a-priori unknown environments and nonlinear components. Black-box neural networks can learn to approximately represent switching dynamics, but typically require a large amount of data, neglect the underlying axioms of physics, and lack of uncertainty quantification. We propose a Gaussian process based learning approach enhanced by switching Port-Hamiltonian systems (GP-SPHS) to learn physical plausible system dynamics and identify the switching condition. The Bayesian nature of Gaussian processes uses collected data to form a distribution over all possible switching policies and dynamics that allows for uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems. A simulation with a hopping robot validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In data science, however, current research often focuses on regression problems, without routinely incorporating additional assumptions about the system that generated the data. Here, we propose to explore a particular type of underlying structure in the data: Hamiltonian systems, where an ``energy'' is conserved. Given a collection of observations of such a Hamiltonian system over time, we extract phase space coordinates and a Hamiltonian function of them that acts as the generator of the system dynamics. The approach employs an autoencoder neural network component to estimate the transformation from observations to the phase space of a Hamiltonian system. An additional neural network component is used to approximate the Hamiltonian function on this constructed space, and the two components are trained jointly. As an alternative approach, we also demonstrate the use of Gaussian processes for the estimation of such a Hamiltonian. After two illustrative examples, we extract an underlying phase space as well as the generating Hamiltonian from a collection of movies of a pendulum. The approach is fully data-driven and does not assume a particular form of the Hamiltonian function.},

  abstract = {Accurate models of robot dynamics are critical for safe and stable control and generalization to novel operational conditions. Hand-designed models, however, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning. This motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot dynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of many robots are described in terms of their generalized coordinates on a matrix Lie group, e.g., on {\textbackslash}textSE(3) for ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation of energy principles. This article proposes a port-Hamiltonian formulation over a Lie group of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) network to approximate the robot dynamics. In contrast to a black-box ODE network, our formulation embeds energy conservation principle and Lie group's constraints in the dynamics model and explicitly accounts for energy-dissipation effect such as friction and drag forces in the dynamics model. We develop energy shaping and damping injection control for the learned, potentially under-actuated Hamiltonian dynamics to enable a unified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with various robot platforms.},

We argue that this property is particularly useful when the external forces are state dependent, in which case it is the pseudo-Hamiltonian structure that facilitates the separation of internal and external forces. Numerical results are provided for a forced and damped mass-spring system and a tank system of higher complexity, and a symmetric fourth-order integration scheme is introduced for improved training on sparse and noisy data.},

In this work, we consider systems that can be modelled as first-order ordinary differential equations. By assuming a certain pseudo-Hamiltonian formulation, we are able to learn the analytic terms of internal dynamics even if the model is trained on data where the system is affected by unknown damping and external disturbances. In cases where it is difficult to find analytic terms for the disturbances, a hybrid model that uses a neural network to learn these can still accurately identify the dynamics of the system as if under ideal conditions. This makes the models applicable in some situations where other system identification models fail. Furthermore, we propose to use a fourth-order symmetric integration scheme in the loss function and avoid actual integration in the training, and demonstrate on varied examples how this leads to increased performance on noisy data.},

Due to the emphasis on the physical structure and modular framework, PH modeling has become a prime focus in system theory. This has led to a considerable research interest in the control of PH systems, resulting in numerous nonlinear control techniques. General nonlinear control methodologies are classified in a spectrum from model-based to model-free, where adaptation and learning typically lie close to the end of the range. Various articles and monographs have provided a detailed overview of model-based control techniques on PH models, but no survey is specifically dedicated to the learning and adaptive control methods that can benefit from the PH structure. To this end, we provide a comprehensive review of the current learning and adaptive control methodologies that have been adapted specifically to PH systems. After establishing the required theoretical background, we elaborate on various general machine learning, iterative learning, and adaptive control techniques and their application to PH systems. For each method we highlight the changes from the general setting due to PH model, followed by a detailed presentation of the respective control algorithm. In general, the advantages of using PH models in learning and adaptive controllers are: i) Prior knowledge in the form of PH model speeds up the learning. ii) In some instances new stability or convergence guarantees are obtained by having a PH model. iii) The resulting control laws can be interpreted in the context of physical systems.

Toward the objective of learning composite models of such systems from data, we present i) a framework for compositional neural networks, ii) algorithms to train these models, iii) a method to compose the learned models, iv) theoretical results that bound the error of the resulting composite models, and v) a method to learn the composition itself, when it is not known a priori. The end result is a modular approach to learning: neural network submodels are trained on trajectory data generated by relatively simple subsystems, and the dynamics of more complex composite systems are then predicted without requiring additional data generated by the composite systems themselves. We achieve this compositionality by representing the system of interest, as well as each of its subsystems, as a port-Hamiltonian neural network (PHNN)---a class of neural ordinary differential equations that uses the port-Hamiltonian systems formulation as inductive bias. We compose collections of PHNNs by using the system's physics-informed interconnection structure, which may be known a priori, or may itself be learned from data. We demonstrate the novel capabilities of the proposed framework through numerical examples involving interacting spring-mass-damper systems. Models of these systems, which include nonlinear energy dissipation and control inputs, are learned independently. Accurate compositions are learned using an amount of training data that is negligible in comparison with that required to train a new model from scratch. Finally, we observe that the composite PHNNs enjoy properties of port-Hamiltonian systems, such as cyclo-passivity---a property that is useful for control purposes.},

This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel method for using pHNNs to identify such subsystems based solely on input-output measurements. By utilizing the inherent compositional property of the port-Hamiltonian systems, we developed an algorithm that learns the dynamics of individual subsystems, without requiring direct access to their internal states.

Intended applications are in moderate-dimensional systems, in particular, long-term tracing of fast charged particles in accelerators and magnetic plasma confinement configurations. The method is based on multi-output Gaussian process (GP) regression on scattered training data. To obtain long-term stability, the symplectic property is enforced via the choice of the matrix-valued covariance function. Based on earlier work on spline interpolation, we observe derivatives of the generating function of a canonical transformation. A product kernel produces an accurate implicit method, whereas a sum kernel results in a fast explicit method from this approach. Both are related to symplectic Euler methods in terms of numerical integration but fulfill a complementary purpose. The developed methods are first tested on the pendulum and the H{\'e}non--Heiles system and results compared to spectral regression of the flow map with orthogonal polynomials. Chaotic behavior is studied on the standard map. Finally, the application to magnetic field line tracing in a perturbed tokamak configuration is demonstrated. As an additional feature, in the limit of small mapping times, the Hamiltonian function can be identified with a part of the generating function and thereby learned from observed time-series data of the system's evolution. For implicit GP methods, we demonstrate regression performance comparable to spectral bases and artificial neural networks for symplectic flow maps, applicability to Poincar{\'e} maps, and correct representation of chaotic diffusion as well as a substantial increase in performance for learning the Hamiltonian function compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract = {Conventional physics-based modeling techniques involve high effort, e.g., time and expert knowledge, while data-driven methods often lack interpretability, structure, and sometimes reliability. To mitigate this, we present a data-driven system identification framework that derives models in the port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable for multi-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical properties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and nonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification. In this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear systems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i) nonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional latent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH properties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural network. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices through Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate transformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process to match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in the latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even nonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size. The method is exemplified by a parametric mass-spring-damper and a nonlinear pendulum example, as well as the high-dimensional model of a disc brake with linear thermoelastic behavior.},

  abstract = {We present a new optimization-based structure-preserving model order reduction (MOR) method for port-Hamiltonian differential--algebraic equations (pH-DAEs). Our method is based on a novel parameterization that allows us to represent any linear time-invariant pH-DAE of a prescribed model order. We propose two algorithms which directly optimize the parameters of a reduced model to approximate a given large-scale model with respect to either the H{$\infty$} or the H2 norm. This approach has several benefits. Our parameterization ensures that the reduced model is again a pH-DAE system and enables a compact representation of the algebraic part of the large-scale model, which in projection-based methods often requires a more involved treatment. The direct optimization is entirely based on transfer function evaluations of the large-scale model and is therefore independent of the structure of the system matrices. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the high accuracy and small reduced model orders in comparison to other structure-preserving MOR methods.},

  abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of flexible objects has become an emerging topic in the community as these objects become more present in many applications, e.g., soft robotics. Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.},

  abstract = {The theory of port-Hamiltonian systems provides a framework for the geometric description of network models of physical systems. It turns out that port-based network models of physical systems immediately lend themselves to a Hamiltonian description. While the usual geometric approach to Hamiltonian systems is based on the canonical symplectic structure of the phase space or on a Poisson structure that is obtained by (symmetry) reduction of the phase space, in the case of a port-Hamiltonian system the geometric structure derives from the interconnection of its sub-systems. This motivates to consider Dirac structures instead of Poisson structures, since this notion enables one to define Hamiltonian systems with algebraic constraints. As a result, any power-conserving interconnection of port-Hamiltonian systems again defines a port-Hamiltonian system.},

The method of Petrov-Galerkin is then used to approximate the balanced realization of the IDPHS by a finite dimensional port Hamiltonian system and to provide the associated reduced order LQG controller. The main advantages of the proposed method are that, first, both control and reduction are driven by closed-loop performances and that, second, due to the passivity properties of the controller the closed-loop stability is guaranteed when the finite dimensional controller is applied to the infinite dimensional system.},
